          "Shallow, fibrous root systems that don't need to store energy for multiple growing seasons",
        perennialCharacteristic:
          'Deep, extensive root systems often with energy storage structures like taproots, rhizomes, bulbs, or tubers',
        visualClues:
          'After pulling plants: annuals come out easily with minimal root structure; perennials resist pulling and may break, leaving parts of roots/rhizomes in soil',
        environmentalContext:
          'In Mediterranean dry summers, perennials often have deeper roots to access water tables unavailable to annuals',
